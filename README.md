# libqgl
> A simple protability and ease-of-use driven graphics library based on OpenGL.

Started from forking [pedroth's linux-framebuffer](https://github.com/pedroth/linux-framebuffer) into [7ways](https://github.com/tty-pt/7ways). 

## Installation
Check out [these instructions](https://github.com/tty-pt/ci/blob/main/docs/install.md#install-ttypt-packages).
And use "libqgl" as the package name.

## Usage
If you have an editor that uses a language server, then you'll get help about the functions in it.

But you can also run stuff like:
```sh
man qgl_flush
```
